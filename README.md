# Physiological responses to emotional speech in hearing impaired and hearing aided older adults

These scripts are for a project measuring skin conductance in response to emotional speech stimuli. The code for running the task, signal processing analysis (using [PHZLAB](https://github.com/gabenespoli/phzlab)), and statistical analysis are provided, but not the actual stimulus files or data collected.

The task and analysis scripts are written in MATLAB; the statistical analyses are written in R.
